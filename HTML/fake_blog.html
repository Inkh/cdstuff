    <h2>Here are some things to interest you!</h2>
    <p>Actually... Google does the job millions of times better.
    <a href="http://www.google.com">Here's</a> a freebie. Go on, I won't judge, really!</p>

    <h3>I see, you're a good bloke and decided to read on</h3>

    <div id="cats">
        <p>So let's talk about cats! Cats are easily the best house pets out there!
        Okay, maybe not. Let's not start a war between dogs and cats because I can't afford
        to do that right now.</p>
        <p>Anyway, let's just say cats are great. For one, they always land on their feet!
        Second of all, did you know their purrs have a healing ability? I read it somewhere
        on the internet, and I'm lazy to find proof, so let's just go with that. Not convinced?
        Below is a summary on why they're great.</p>
    </div>

    <ul>
        <li>Cats land on their feet</li>
        <li>Purrs can heal you</li>
        <li>They're independent</li>
        <li>They're funny, kinda</li>
        <li>They have <span style="color:blue">blue</span> eyes! Well, some of them at least</li>
    </ul>
    </br></br>

    <p> STILL not convinced?! Okay, let's compare the common household cat to some other common household pets.</p>

    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Cat</th>
                <th>Iguana</th>
                <th>Spider</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <tr>
                <td>Independent</td>
                <td>Sits there</td>
                <td>Frightens Guests</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Sometimes Frightens Guests</td>
                <td>Sits there</td>
                <td>Frightens Guests</td>
            </tr>
            <tr>
                <td>Sometimes sits there</td>
                <td>Sits there</td>
                <td>Frightens Guests</td>
            </tr>
        </tbody>
    </table>
