1. Open Terminal 
win+r , type in cmd, launch cmd

2. Navigate to your desktop
cd desktop

3. Create a new directory, call it test 
md test

4. Make files called index.html, styles.css, commands.txt inside the test directory
cd test, copy NUL index.html, copy NUL styles.css, copy NUL commands.txt

5. Make a copy of index.html and call it index_2.html
copy index.html index_2.html

6. Navigate back to your desktop and make another directory, call it 'destination'.
cd.., md destination

7. Move the index_2.html file to the 'destination' directory.
cd test, move index_2.html C:\Users\jhwe9\Desktop\destination

8. In the 'test' directory, remove the 'styles.css' file.
del styles.css

9. Now, check and see what files are in the 'test' and 'destination' directories.
dir, cd.., cd destination, dir

10. Remove/delete the 'destination' directory.
rd /s destination, Y on prompt (cmd won't recognize deltree, so found an equivalent)
